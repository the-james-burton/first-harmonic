A full-market, fundamentals based, relative weighting methodology. We start by downloading the latest list of UK listed companies from the London Stock Exchange website. After parsing these LSE spreadsheets, we then download the latest ratios from the Reuters website for each company. These ratios are then parsed and analysed to produce reports that help investors choose 'best in sector' stocks with good fundamentals without any prior knowledge. This all happens in just 'one click'.

The software is written in Java, using Apache POI to read spreadsheets, Velocity to create the report, Commons Math for some basic statistical analysis and jTidy to format the HTML.

The sector report looks like this...
